These scripts help in generating population files supporting the API

### Files 
Population data requires addition of two types of files:

- `population.json`: This file contains information about the VCF fields containing the population data
- `population_metadata.json`: This file contains the metadata about a population like the population structure, the collection it belongs to

### File generation
API usable files are generated by populating the seed-files first.

Seed-files are keyed by species `production_name`
The file `scripts/population/seed-files/populations.json` is copied directly from `ensembl-variation-pipelines`
 
The file `scripts/population/seed-files/population_metadata.json`is populated with the help of `scripts/population/fetch_population_metadata_seed.py` 
This script uses a `db.ini` file to fetch the cooresponding database from the list of assemblies in `assemblies.txt`


Using these seed-files, API usable files are generated by running `scripts/population/fetch_population.py` and `scripts/population/fetch_population_metadata.py`
These scripts use `db.ini` to fetch genome_uuids from the database

Finally, the files are copied to `common/file_model`
